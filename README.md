‚óè API Integration: The app connects to the Unsplash API to retrieve real-time image data.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following before starting:

‚óè Python 3.x installed.

‚óè An API key from Unsplash to access their services.

‚óè Basic Python libraries including streamlit, requests, and python-dotenv.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ‚óè Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. Install dependencies:

   ‚óè Install the required Python packages using pip.

3. Unsplash API Setup:

   ‚óè Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Unsplash API key for authentication.

4. Run the application:

   ‚óè Launch the app locally by running the Streamlit script.
# How It Works
# API Key Management
The application securely loads the Unsplash API key from a .env file using python-dotenv to protect sensitive information. This key is required to interact with the Unsplash API.

# Image Search Functionality
The application takes a user-provided prompt and sends it as a query to the Unsplash API. In return, the API responds with a set of image URLs matching the prompt. The images are then processed and displayed dynamically.

# User Interface
Streamlit is used to build a simple and responsive UI. Users can input a search prompt, and the application will display the search results in a grid format, with each image labeled and resized for a clean viewing experience.

# Usage Instructions
1. Run the application.
2. Input a search term: Type a keyword or phrase in the input box (e.g., ‚Äúmountains‚Äù or ‚Äúcityscape‚Äù).
3. View results: The images related to your search will be displayed in a grid format.
4. Explore: Scroll through the images and enjoy!
